# React Tutorial

## Requirements

### Node

### HTML

## Create a new Project

`npx create-react-app app-name`

### Note

The app name cannot be capital

### Tip

Files like setupTests.js, reportWebVitals.js, app.test.js and logo.svg are useless for us, hence delete them and their usage in the code

## Run the app locally

`npm start`

## Introduction

### Public folder

contains the files accessible by the browser.

### Root DIV

Everything gets rendered into a single div

### Index.js

The file that initializes our project.

### App.js

### package.json

Note: You can run any script stated in this file through `npm run {name of script}`
